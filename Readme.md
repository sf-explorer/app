## Boards

We are providing free templates exploring various Salesforce clouds and capabilities. Each template is self-contained and can be shared.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Open and read boards** without needing to be connected to an org
- **View custom attributes** when opened in context to your org
- **Select a user** and analyze the associated security model
- **Add your own objects** and customize templates
- **Share your own specific templates** with others

These boards serve as comprehensive data models and relationship diagrams for different Salesforce use cases, helping you understand the object structure and relationships within each domain.

**Collaboration:** This repository is designed for collaboration - feel free to share concepts, contribute new boards, or suggest other Salesforce clouds not yet covered here.
