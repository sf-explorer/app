# Welcome to the livedoc
> In case you were wondering what the black box at the bottom is â€“ it's the debug view, showing the current state of the editor. You can disable it by pressing on the settings control in the bottom-left of your screen and toggling the debug view setting.
The livedoc is a demo env**ironment** built with `@lexical/react`. Try typing in **some text** with *different* formats.
Make sure to check out the various plugins in the toolbar. You can also use #hashtags or @-mentions too!
