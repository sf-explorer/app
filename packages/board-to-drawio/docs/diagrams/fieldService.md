## 🚀 How to View

### Option 1: Generate Locally (Recommended)
The best way to work with this diagram is to generate it locally:

```bash
# From the package root
npm run build
node scripts/regenerate-all.cjs
```

This creates `output/fieldService.drawio` which you can:
- Open with [draw.io desktop app](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases)
- Edit in [VS Code with Draw.io extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
- Upload to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)

### Option 2: View Online
For the full viewer URL (may not work in all browsers), see:
**[viewer-urls.md](../viewer-urls.md)** - Look for "Field Service" section

> ⚠️ **Note:** Viewer URLs are very long (embedded XML) and may not work in Firefox/Safari.  
> GitHub also doesn't render them well. We recommend Option 1.
