# How to Open Draw.io Files

The `.drawio` files in the `output/` folder are diagram files that need to be opened with draw.io, not a text editor.

## Quick Start: Open in Browser

1. Go to **https://app.diagrams.net**
2. Click "Open Existing Diagram"
3. Navigate to this folder: `/Users/ndespres/app/packages/board-to-drawio/output/`
4. Select any `.drawio` file (e.g., `actionPlan.drawio`)
5. View and edit your diagram!

## OR: Use VS Code Extension

1. In VS Code, go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X or Ctrl+Shift+X)
2. Search: **"Draw.io Integration"**
3. Install by **Henning Dieterichs**
4. Click any `.drawio` file - it will open visually!

## OR: Download Desktop App

1. Visit: **https://www.diagrams.net/**
2. Download for Mac/Windows/Linux
3. Open app → File → Open → Select `.drawio` file

## What You'll See

When properly opened, you'll see:
- ✅ **Table Names** at the top of each table
- ✅ **Fields** listed with types (e.g., "Id: Text", "Name: Text")
- ✅ **Arrows** connecting specific fields (showing relationships)
- ✅ **Primary Keys** (🔑) and **Foreign Keys** (🔗)
- ✅ **Color-coded** tables
- ✅ **Group zones** (containers)

## File Format Note

`.drawio` files are actually **XML files** containing diagram data. They're not meant to be read as text - they need draw.io to render the visual diagram!
